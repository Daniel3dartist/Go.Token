Unfortunately, Godot does not provide support for image .gif files by default, to be able to manipulate files of this type (separate frames into single files or take an image sequence and transform it into a GIF), we need to use ImageMagick.

## What is ImageMagick?

ImageMagick is a popular cross-platform open source software made for manipulating image files. You can find more information about it at [imagemagick.org](https://imagemagick.org/index.php).

Since GO.Token is cross-platform, we need to download the files for Windows and Linux. Download using the links below:

- [Windows](https://imagemagick.org/archive/binaries/ImageMagick-7.1.1-32-portable-Q16-HDRI-x64.zip)
- [Linux](https://imagemagick.org/archive/binaries/magick)

### Windows
Extract the files in the path: ~/Go.Token/dependency/ImageMagick/ImageMagick_Windows/

### Linux
Copy the file in the path: ~/Go.Token/dependency/ImageMagick/ImageMagick_Linux/


And ready! All dependencies have been configured properly.
